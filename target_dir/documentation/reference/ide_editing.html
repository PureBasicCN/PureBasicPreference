PureBasic IDE用到基本的编辑功能时，就像任何其他的文本编辑器一样. 光标键以及 上翻页键 / 下翻页键，Home 键和 End 键可以用来浏览代码. Ctrl+Home定位到文件开始，按Ctrl +End定位到文件结束. <br><br>默认快捷键 Ctrl+C (复制), Ctrl+X (剪切) and Ctrl+V (粘贴) 用于代码编辑.  "Insert" 键控制文本是否插入或者覆盖 . Delete 删除键用于向前删除 . 按住 Shift 键和光标可以选择文本. <br><br>此外, IDE有很多额外的编辑功能，具体到编程或者PureBasict. <br>
<br>


<p><b>缩进:</b></p><blockquote>

当您按下回车键时，当前行和下一行的缩进（开头处的空格数/Tab数）将根据存在于这些行上的 <a href="general_rules.html">关键词</a>而自动更正 . “块模式”也可以在新的一行得到与前一个行相同的缩进. 此功能的详细信息可以在 <a href="ide_preferences.html">文件-配置</a>中定制. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Tab 制表符:</b></p><blockquote>

默认情况下, PureBasic IDE 按下Tab键时，并不会插入一个真正的tab制表符, 正如许多程序员认为在源代码中使用真正的tab制表符是件很糟糕的事情. <br><br>tab符将被插入2个空格符所替代. 此行为方式可以在配置项中改变. 点击查看更多 <a href="ide_preferences.html">自定义 IDE</a>的信息. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>特殊的 Tab 行为:</b></p><blockquote>

无字符或者选择一些字符，当按下Tab键时，Tab键将会产生特殊行为  (根据配置方式，当前行前面将会插入一些空格符或者真正的tab制表). <br><br>当一行或者多行被选中时，. 在每一行的前面都将会插入空格符或者tab制表符. 这增加了整个选定块的缩进. <br><br>按下Shift+Tab时，多行文本将反转缩进. 它将在每一行开始处移除空格符 / tab符，为的是使整个选中区块减少缩进. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Indentation/Alignment of comments:</b></p><blockquote>



Similar to the special tab behavior above, the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+E and Ctrl+Shift+E 
(CMD+E and CMD+Shift+E on OSX) can be used to change the indentation of only the comments 
in a selected block of code. This helps in aligning comments at the end of code lines to 
make the code more readable. The used shortcut can be configured in the 
<a href="ide_preferences.html">preferences</a>. 


 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Selecting blocks of code:</b></p><blockquote>



The shortcut Ctrl+M (CMD+M on OSX) can be used to select the block of code that 
contains caret position (i.e. the surrounding If block, loop or procedure). 
Repeated usage of the shortcut selects further surrounding code blocks. 
<br>
<br>
The shortcut Ctrl+Shift+M (CMD+Shift+M on OSX) reverses the behavior and reverts the 
selection to the block that was selected before the last usage of the Ctrl+M shortcut. 
<br>
<br>
The used shortcuts can be configured in the <a href="ide_preferences.html">preferences</a>. 

 

</blockquote>
<p><b>双击原码中的文本 :</b></p><blockquote>

像往常一样，双击一个词可以选择整个单词. 然而在某些情况下，双击有特殊的意义: <br><br>按住Ctrl键的同时，双击当前源码定义的<a href="procedures.html">procedure过程 （函数）</a> 名，光标自动跳到本函数的声明处. <br><br>双击  <a href="includes.html">IncludeFile</a> 或者 <a href="includes.html">XincludeFile</a> 声明,  IDE 将试着打开声明所指向的文件. (This is only possible if the included file is written as a literal string, and not through for example a constant.) <br><br>In the same way, if you double-click on an IncludeBinary statement, the IDE will try to display that file in the internal <a href="ide_tools.html">file viewer</a>. 

</blockquote>
<p><b>匹配括号和标记关键字:</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_main_match.png"></p>



When the cursor is on an opening or closing brace the IDE will highlight the other brace that matches it. If a 
matching brace could not be found (which is a syntax error in PureBasic) the IDE will highlight the current 
brace in red. This same concept is applied to keywords. If the cursor is on a Keyword such as "If", the IDE 
will underline this keyword and all keywords that belong to it such as "Else" or "EndIf". If there is a mismatch 
in the keywords it will be underlined in red. The "Goto matching Keyword" menu entry described below can be 
used to quickly move between the matching keywords. 
<br>
<br>
The brace and keyword matching can be configured in the <a href="ide_preferences.html">Preferences</a>. 


 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Command help in the status bar:</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_main_commandhelp.png"></p>



While typing, the IDE will show the needed parameters for any PureBasic function 
whose parameters you are currently typing. This makes it easy to see any more 
parameters you still have to add to this function. This also works for <a href="procedures.html">procedures</a>, 
<a href="prototypes.html">prototypes</a>, <a href="interfaces.html">interfaces</a> or 
<a href="import_endimport.html">imported functions</a> in your code as long as they are declared in the same source 
code or <a href="ide_projects.html">project</a>. 

 

</blockquote>
<p><b>Folding options:</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_main_folding.png"></p>

When special folding keywords are encountered (<b><font color="#3A3966">Procedure</font></b> / <b><font color="#3A3966">EndProcedure</font></b> by default. 
More can be added), the IDE marks the region between these keywords on the left side 
next to the line numbers with a [-] at the starting point, followed by a vertical line to the end point. 
<br>
<br>
By clicking on the [-], you can hide ("fold") that section of source code to keep a better 
overview of larger source files. The [-] will turn into a [+]. By clicking again, the code will 
again be shown ("unfolded") again. 
<br>
<br>
Note: Even though the state of these folded code lines is remembered when you save/reopen the file, 
the actual created code file always contains all lines. This only affects the display of the code 
in the IDE, not the code itself. 
<br>
<br>
Another default fold keyword is ";{" and ";}". Since ";" marks a comment in PB, these will be 
totally ignored by the compiler. However, they provide the possibility to place custom fold 
points that do not correspond to a specific PB keyword. 


 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Auto complete:</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_main_autocomplete.png"></p>

So that you do not have to remember the exact name of every command, there is the Auto complete 
feature to make things easier. 
<br>
<br>
After you have typed the beginning of a command, a list of possible matches to the word start 
you have just typed will be displayed. A list of options is also displayed when you typed a 
structured variable or interface followed by a "\". 
<br>
<br>
You can then select one of these words with the up/down keys and insert it at the point you 
are by pressing the Tab key. You can also continue typing while the list is open. It will select the 
first match that is still possible after what you typed, and close automatically when either 
you have just typed an exact match or if there are no more possible matches in the list. 
<br>
<br>
Escape closes the auto complete list at any time. It also closes if you click with the mouse 
anywhere within the IDE. 
<br>
<br>
Note: You can configure what is displayed in the Auto complete list, as well as turning off the 
automatic popup (requiring a keyboard shortcut such as Ctrl+Space to open list) in the 
Preferences. 
See the Auto complete section of <a href="ide_preferences.html">Customizing the IDE</a> for more information.

<p><b>Tools Panel on the side:</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_main_toolspanel.png"></p>

Many tools to make navigating/editing the source code easier can be added to the Tools Panel 
on the side of the editor window. For an overview of them and how to configure them, 
see <a href="ide_tools.html">Built-in Tools</a>. 


 


</blockquote>
<p><b>The Edit Menu:</b></p><blockquote>



Following is an explanation of the Items in the Edit menu. Note that many of the Edit 
menu items are also accessible by right clicking on the source code, which opens a popup menu. 

 

<p><img src="images/ide_menu_edit.png"></p>

<b>Undo</b> 
<br>
Undoes the last done action in the code editing area. There is an undo buffer, 
so several actions can be undone. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Redo</b> 
<br>
Redo the last action undone by the undo function. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Cut</b> 
<br>
Copy the selected part of the source code to the clipboard and remove it from the code. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Copy</b> 
<br>
Copy the selected text to the Clipboard without deleting it from the code. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Paste</b> 
<br>
Insert the content of the Clipboard at the current position in the code. If any text is 
selected before this, it will be removed and replaced with the content of the Clipboard. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Insert comments</b> 
<br>
Inserts a comment (";") before every line of the selected code block. This makes 
commenting large blocks of code easier than putting the ; before each line manually. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Remove comments</b> 
<br>
Removes the comment characters at the beginning of each selected line. This reverts the 
"Insert comments" command, but also works on comments manually set. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Format indentation</b> 
<br>
Reformats the indentation of the selected lines to align with the code above them and to 
reflect the <a href="general_rules.html">keywords</a> that they contain. The rules for the indentation can be specified in the 
<a href="ide_preferences.html">preferences</a>. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Select all</b> 
Selects the whole source code. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Goto</b> 
<br>
This lets you jump to a specific line in your source code. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Goto matching Keyword</b> 
<br>
If the cursor is currently on a keyword such as "If" this menu option jumps directly to the keyword 
that matches it (in this case "EndIf"). 

<br>
<br>

<b>Goto recent line</b> 
<br>
The IDE keeps track of the lines you view. For example if you switch to a different line 
with the above Goto function, or with the <a href="ide_tools.html">Procedure Browser</a> tool. With this menu option 
you can jump back to the previous position. 20 such past cursor positions are remembered. 
<br>
<br>
Note that this only records greater jumps in the code. Not if you just move up/down a few 
lines with the cursor keys. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Toggle current fold</b> 
<br>
This opens/closes the fold point in which the cursor is currently located. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Toggle all Folds</b> 
<br>
This opens/closes all fold points in the current source. Very useful to for example hide 
all procedures in the code. Or to quickly see the whole code again when some of the code is folded. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Add/Remove Marker</b> 
<br>
Markers act like Bookmarks in the source code. There presence is indicated by a little arrow 
next to the line numbers. You can later jump to these markers with the "Jump to marker" command. 
<br>
<br>
The "Add/Remove Marker" sets or removes a marker from the current line you are editing. 
<br>
<br>
Note: You can also set/remove markers by holding down the Ctrl Key and clicking on the border that 
holds the markers (not the Line-number part of it). 

<br>
<br>

<b>Jump to Marker</b> 
<br>
This makes the cursor jump to the next marker position further down the code from the current 
cursor position. If there is no marker after the cursor position, it jumps to the first on in the 
source code. So by pressing the "Jump to Marker" shortcut (F2 by default) several times, you can 
jump to all the markers in the code. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Clear Markers</b> 
This removes all markers from the current source code. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Find/Replace</b> 

<p><img src="images/ide_edit_search.png"></p>



The find/replace dialog enables you to search for specific words in your code, and 
also to replace them with something else. 
<br>
<br>
The "Find Next" button starts the search. The search can be continued after a match is found with the 
Find Next menu command (F3 by default). 
<br>
<br>
You can make the search more specific by enabling one of the checkboxes: 
<br>
<u>Case Sensitive</u> : Only text that matches the exact case of the search word will be found. 
<br>
<u>Whole Words only</u> : Search for the given word as a whole word. Do not display results where the search word is part of another word. 
<br>
<u>Don't search in Comments</u> : Any match that is found inside a comment is ignored. 
<br>
<u>Don't search in Strings</u> : Any match that is found inside a literal string (in " ") is ignored. 
<br>
<u>Search inside Selection only</u> : Searches only the selected region of code. This is really useful 
only together with the "Replace All" button, in which case it will replace any found match, but only inside the selected region. 
<br>
<br>
By enabling the "Replace with" checkbox, you go into replace mode. "Find Next" will still only search, but 
with each click on the "Replace" button, the next match of the search word will be replaced by whatever is 
inside the "Replace with" box. 
<br>
<br>
By clicking on "Replace All", all matches from the current position downwards will be replaced 
(unless "Search inside Selection only" is set). 

<br>
<br>

<b>Find Next</b> 
<br>
This continues the search for the next match of the last search started by the Find/Replace dialog. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Find in Files</b> 

<p><img src="images/ide_edit_searchfiles.png"></p>



The Find in Files Dialog lets you carry out a search inside many files in a specific directory. 
<br>
<br>
You have to specify a search keyword, as well as a base directory ("root directory") in which to 
search. You can customize the searched files by specifying extension filters. 
Any number of filters can be given separated by ",". (*.* or an empty extension field searches all files). 
As with "Find/Replace", there are checkboxes to make the search more specific. 
<br>
<br>
The "Include sub-directories" checkbox makes it search (recursively) inside any subdirectory of the given root directory too. 
<br>
<br>
When starting the search, a separate window will be opened displaying the search results, giving the file, 
line number as well as the matched line of each result. 
<br>
<br>
Double-clicking on an entry in the result window opens 
that file in the IDE and jumps to the selected result line.
